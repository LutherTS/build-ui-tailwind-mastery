So, in the chaos, I grabbed the baby and ran. My only explanation is that I had occasionally been asked to look after it. I heard my mother screaming behind me, "No! We must kill the child!" But only a moment later, she was killed... Killed by the same people they'd asked me to lead into the castle. Afterward, war broke out, and eventually I came to understand what had happened. Thinking back on it now, I can't say I should have done anything different. But all that is in the past now. It's all meaningless at this point. There is only one side to be on: Fáfnir's. Fáfnir is ALL there is. Hmph. And who are you to disagree, Summoner?`,
